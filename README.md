Local Development
-----------------

### Requirements

* Git - http://git-scm.com
* Vagrant - http://vagrantup.com
* VirtualBox - http://virtualbox.org

### Intro

For local development, we use [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com). This allows us to replicate
the same testing environment on every computer. 

### Working

Once Vagrant is installed and the repo is cloned, run the following commands:

    vagrant up

The first time you run this, the virtual box image will be downloaded and installed. Then,
Vagrant will set up the development environment.
